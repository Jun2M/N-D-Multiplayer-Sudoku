N Dimentional multiplayer Sudoku game.

# Rules

Firstly, decide how big the board (hypercube that game is played on) is going to be by inputting the length, and dimention.
In a given turn, the program randomly assigns a cell in the board to fill in with number between 1 to length of the board.
If the opponent thinks the board is no longer solvable, the oppenent can challenge the entry.
If the board is indeed unsolvable, whoever challged wins and otherwise, loses.
If not challenged, its is now the opponent's turn to fill in a cell.
If no one challenged until the board is full, draw? and play in the bigger board to make it harder?
